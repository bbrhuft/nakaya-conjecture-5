Manuscript and exact PARI/GP verification for a deduction of two conjectures of Nakaya (*J. Number Theory* 204 (2019)) on the supersingular polynomial ss<sub>p</sub><sup>(N\*)</sup> attached to the Fricke group Γ<sub>0</sub>(N)<sup>+</sup>, at every prime level N ∈ {3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 41, 47, 59, 71} and every prime p ≥ 5, p ≠ N:

- **Conjecture 5:** a class-number formula for the number of linear factors of ss<sub>p</sub><sup>(N\*)</sup> over 𝔽<sub>p</sub> (Corollary 1.2);
- **Conjecture 6:** a formula for the degree of ss<sub>p</sub><sup>(N\*)</sup>, the total number of supersingular points on X<sub>0</sub>(N)<sup>+</sup> (Corollary 1.3).

Together with Aricheta's theorem, they determine the factorization over 𝔽<sub>p</sub>: ss<sub>p</sub><sup>(N\*)</sup> has that many linear factors and exactly g(X<sub>0</sub>(Np)/⟨w<sub>N</sub>, w<sub>p</sub>⟩) irreducible quadratic factors (Corollary 6.3).

As a secondary result, Section 7 gives a uniform form of Nakaya's **Conjecture 4** (the multiplicities in the resultant Res<sub>X</sub>(ss<sub>p</sub>(X), R<sub>N</sub>(X, Y)), whose radical is ss<sub>p</sub><sup>(N\*)</sup>) at all fifteen levels in 𝔖 (Proposition 7.1). Nakaya stated Conjecture 4 only for N = 2, 3, 5, 7, and Morton (*Int. J. Number Theory* 19 (2023)) proved those four cases; Proposition 7.1 recovers them and supplies the analogues at the other eleven levels. Remarks 6.4 and 8.4 record consequences for Nakaya's Question 1 and Observation 3, alongside the earlier results of Morton and Hajouji (arXiv:2303.09096); Remark 8.4 explains, for N, p ≥ 5, the symmetry Hajouji observed in his table of quadratic-factor counts.

> **Status: draft, not yet reviewed by a specialist.** The proofs assemble known results (Deligne–Rapoport, Aricheta's Theorem 3.1, Ogg's and Im–Jeon–Kim's fixed-point formulas, the genus formula, tame ramification of the j-map) and make no priority claim for the underlying geometric identities. Nakaya proved N = 3 of Conjecture 6, and Morton proved N = 5 and N = 7. See `notes/AUTHOR_NOTES.md`.

## Idea of the proofs

1. Nakaya's Hauptmodul is an integral coordinate on X<sub>0</sub>(N)<sup>+</sup>, so the roots of ss<sub>p</sub><sup>(N\*)</sup> are the supersingular points of X<sub>0</sub>(N)<sup>+</sup> in characteristic p, and the linear factors are the 𝔽<sub>p</sub>-rational ones (Proposition 5.1).
2. The Deligne–Rapoport model of X<sub>0</sub>(Np) mod p is two copies of X<sub>0</sub>(N) glued at the supersingular points. Quotienting by Atkin–Lehner involutions and comparing genera gives the three identities displayed below: the rational count (Theorem 1.1), the total count in genus zero (Lemma 3.1), and Aricheta's identity, rederived from the same quotient model (Lemma 3.2).
3. Ogg's fixed-point formula and the genus formula for X<sub>0</sub>(Np) turn these into Nakaya's two formulas (Sections 4–6).

Here X = X<sub>0</sub>(N)<sup>+</sup>, B = X<sub>0</sub>(Np)/⟨w<sub>N</sub>, w<sub>p</sub>⟩, D is the total number of supersingular points on X in characteristic p, and λ = λ<sub>p</sub>(X) is the number of 𝔽<sub>p</sub>-rational ones. The terms r<sub>p</sub>(Np) and r<sub>Np</sub>(Np) count fixed points of the Atkin–Lehner involutions w<sub>p</sub> and w<sub>Np</sub> on X<sub>0</sub>(Np) over ℂ.

For N = 7 this settles the case of Conjecture 5 that Morton (*Ramanujan J.* 63 (2024), §3) had reduced to his Conjectures 1–3, of which he proved Conjecture 1 (Theorem A). It does not prove his finer Conjectures 2–3.

Only step 1 needs N ∈ 𝔖. The same arguments count the rational supersingular points (Corollary 5.2) and, with a genus correction, all supersingular points (Proposition 6.2) on X<sub>0</sub>(N)<sup>+</sup> at **every odd prime level N**, including levels where X<sub>0</sub>(N)<sup>+</sup> has positive genus.

## Reproducing the verification

The current manuscript corresponds to release v1.2, archived on Zenodo as doi:10.5281/zenodo.23778165. Release v1.2 revises Section 7 and Remarks 6.4 and 8.4 after a source check, and adds the independent checks described below. Release v1.1 (doi:10.5281/zenodo.23750884) added Section 7 (Conjecture 4) and Appendix A.7; release v1.0 (doi:10.5281/zenodo.23698277) matches the earlier manuscript without Section 7. All commands are run from `verification/`. "Reconstructed" means the run rebuilds the Hauptmoduli and modular relations from spaces of modular forms; "stored" means it reads `relations/relation_N.gp`, produced by the reconstructing run under PARI/GP 2.15.4; "none" means it uses only the classical supersingular polynomial and the modular polynomial Φ<sub>N</sub>.

`verify_nakaya.gp` writes `verification.csv`, `relation_N.gp` and `polynomials_N.gp`. To load its functions without running a survey, set `NK_NO_RUN=1` before `read`.

**PARI/GP 2.15.x** (as used for the recorded run):
```sh
cd verification
gp -fq -s 256000000 verify_nakaya.gp
# expected final line: ALL PASSED: 827 cases   (all 14 levels, 5 ≤ p ≤ 300)
```

**PARI/GP 2.17.x**: `verify_nakaya.gp` stops at N = 13 with `unexpected Hauptmodul dimension`. Levels 3, 5, 7 and 11 run unchanged. At N = 13 the construction uses `mf=mfinit([13,12],4)`, the full space M<sub>12</sub>(Γ<sub>0</sub>(13)) of dimension 15, and `at=mfatkininit(mf,13)`, whose normalizing constant `at[3]` is 1. In that environment the matrix `at[2]` does not satisfy `at[2]^2 = 1`, and its +1 eigenspace (the eigenvalue (−1)<sup>k/2</sup> required for k = 12) has dimension 7 instead of the expected m + 1 = 8, so the dimension check fails. The same construction passed all checks under 2.15.4. The cause has not been isolated, and no PARI defect is claimed. Use the stored relations instead (or load `relation_N.gp`, set `NK_NO_RUN=1`, and call `nk_polynomial`, `nk_rhs` and `nk_fixed` directly):
```sh
pip install cypari2
cd verification
python run_extended.py 2000          # Conjecture 5
python c6_degrees.py 1500            # Conjecture 6
gp -fq -s 1000000000 c6_direct.gp    # Conjecture 6, direct count from Phi_N
```

### Conjecture 5 (linear factors)

| Run | PARI version | Range | Pairs | Mismatches |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `verify_nakaya.gp` | 2.15.4 | p ≤ 300 | 827 | 0 |
| level-2 supplement | 2.15.4 | p ≤ 300 | 60 | 0 |
| `run_extended.py` | 2.17.2 | p ≤ 2000 | 4201 | 0 |
| `verify_general.gp`, levels 11–23 (control) | 2.17.2 | p ≤ 1300, p ≡ 1 (mod 12) | 230 | 0 |
| `verify_general.gp`, levels 37–73 (outside 𝔖) | 2.17.2 | p ≤ 1300, p ≡ 1 (mod 12) | 238 | 0 |
| `verify_general.gp`, levels 79–127 (outside 𝔖) | 2.17.2 | p ≤ 600, p ≡ 1 (mod 12) | 58 | 0 |

**General-level check** (Appendix A.5 of the paper). Run in PARI/GP with `gp -fq -s 512000000 verify_general.gp`, or set `VG_LEVELS` and `VG_MAXP` before `read`. Points over a Frobenius-stable pair (j, j′) with several isogenies are separated by the branch tangents of Φ<sub>N</sub>(x, y) = 0; 10,881 such points were resolved. 237 small pairs (all with p < 4N) had a repeated tangent slope and were skipped and reported, not guessed. Primes p ≢ 1 (mod 12) are not covered by this check. Full log: `results/general_levels_run.log`.

### Conjecture 6 (degree)

| Run | PARI version | Range | Pairs | Mismatches |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `c6_degrees.py`: degrees recorded by `verify_nakaya.gp` | 2.17.2 | p ≤ 300 | 827 | 0 |
| `c6_degrees.py`: fresh degrees from stored relations | 2.17.2 | 300 < p ≤ 1500 | 2478 | 0 |
| `conjecture6_second_implementation/` (direct degrees) | 2.15.4 | p ≤ 300 and p = 307, 401, 503, 1009 | 883 | 0 |
| `conjecture6_second_implementation/` (cusp-form traces) | 2.15.4 | p = 5, 7, 13 | 39 | 0 |
| `c6_direct.gp`: Nakaya levels 11–31 | 2.17.2 | p ≤ 700, p ≡ 1 (mod 12) | 167 | 0 |
| `c6_direct.gp`: levels 37–73, Proposition 6.2 (genus 1–2) | 2.17.2 | p ≤ 600, p ≡ 1 (mod 12) | 87 | 0 |
| `c6_direct.gp`: level-3 fixed points r<sub>3</sub>(3p) | 2.17.2 | 5 ≤ p ≤ 43 | 12 | 0 |

Logs: `results/c6_degrees.log`, `results/c6_direct.log`. The second implementation's own `SHA256SUMS.json` also lists a draft report (`Report.*`) that the merged paper supersedes and that is not included; every other listed file matches its checksum.

### Conjecture 4 (resultant multiplicities)

| Run | PARI version | Range | Pairs | Mismatches |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `conjecture4/code/verify_c4.gp`, all 15 levels in 𝔖 | 2.15.4 | 5 ≤ p ≤ 400, p ≠ N | 1127 (1051 odd-level, 76 at N = 2) | 0 |
| of which collision-flagged pairs: 239 with a repeated factor of A<sub>N</sub> or B<sub>N</sub>, or a common factor of two of A<sub>N</sub>, B<sub>N</sub>, E<sub>N</sub> mod p; 7 where only the discriminant of the plane model vanishes mod p | 2.15.4 | same | 246 | 0 |
| `conjecture4/independent/flint_c4.py`: re-implementation in FLINT from the stored a<sub>N</sub>, b<sub>N</sub> | python-flint 0.9.0 | 5 ≤ p ≤ 2000, p ≠ N | 4502 | 0 |
| `conjecture4/independent/check_relations.gp`: R<sub>N</sub> against Morton (N = 2, 3, 5, 7) and against Φ<sub>N</sub> (all 15 levels, random fibres) | 2.15.4 | — | 15 levels | 0 |

The script reconstructs R<sub>N</sub> from modular forms, extracts the correction polynomials A<sub>N</sub>, B<sub>N</sub>, E<sub>N</sub>, confirms that they reproduce Nakaya's four sets of correction factors, and compares every exponent in the factorization of the resultant with Proposition 7.1. It deliberately refuses PARI versions other than 2.15.4, since it uses the same Hauptmodul construction as `verify_nakaya.gp`. Log: `conjecture4/results/run.log`; checksums: `conjecture4/SHA256SUMS.json`. A rerun under PARI/GP 2.15.4 on 29 October 2026 reproduced every result file except for timing fields. The discriminant of every E<sub>N</sub> has no prime factor other than 2, 3 and N, so its reduction is squarefree for every prime p ≥ 5, p ≠ N, as the proof requires. Morton's theorem and section numbers, in the paper and the memorandum, are cited from arXiv:2105.14532v1; the journal version was not accessible. The memorandum in `conjecture4/report/` is kept as written; where the paper differs from it (for example, it no longer cites Beneish–Wen's Proposition 3.16), the paper and `notes/SOURCE_AUDIT.md` take precedence.

### Remark 8.4 (Hajouji's Table 1)

`hajouji_table1/hajouji_table1.gp` transcribes Hajouji's Table 1 (arXiv:2303.09096v3, Section 2.5): the number of irreducible quadratic factors over 𝔽<sub>p</sub> of the level-ℓ supersingular polynomial, for all pairs of primes in 𝔖. It compares each entry with g(X<sub>0</sub>(pℓ)\*), the count given by Corollary 6.3, computed from traces of Hecke operators on weight-two newforms. All 105 off-diagonal pairs agree, including those with 2 or 3, which the proof does not cover. Log: `hajouji_table1/hajouji_table1.log`.

Finite agreement checks the implementation and normalisations; it is not a substitute for the proofs.
